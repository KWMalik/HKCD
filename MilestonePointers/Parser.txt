Parser Milestone

----------------
Output Files
----------------

The output of our parser can be found in two locations, separated by the "good" tests and the "bad" tests. The results of the "good" tests are found in:

/Test/Files/Parser/FullParserTestCases/Good/FullTests/Out/.

The results of the "bad" tests are found in:

/Test/Files/Parser/FullParserTestCases/Bad/FullTests/Out/.

The names of the output files map directly to the names of the input files. Our parser is bottom-up, so files which it correctly parses, the start production will be last. If it does not correctly parse a file, the output file will include all productions parsed up to the failure point and then the corresponding error message.

----------------
Source Code
----------------

There are three relevant source code files, which are all located in /lib/. main.j is the entry point for program. grammar.json is the grammar definition, both for lexical analysis and parsing. Finally, Parser.j is a simple wrapper around Jison to execute the parser that is dynamically generated.
