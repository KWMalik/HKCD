-----------
The source code for this milestone is located in /lib/.

ASTNode/
  NodeEmitter.js                          -> The emitter mixin which adds an emit() function to each node

CodeEmitter.js                            -> Target-machine (JVM) specific code emitter

CodeGenerator.js                          -> Module to start node-visiting and write the generated code to a file

<<<<<<< HEAD
CodeRunner.js                             -> Runs jasmine and the JVM

ResultReporter.js                         -> Reports results (...) but also grabs all relevant output (error messages)

--------------
Program Output
--------------
The output for the test cases is located in /Test/Files/CodeGen/Full/FullTests/Out/ (sorry). The names should match the names of the test cases provided.
=======
CodeRunner.js                             -> Runs the Jasmin assembler on the code to generate Java class files and then uses Java to run the code

Compiler.js                               -> Ties together all the compiler modules to execute them in a pipeline

Output
------
