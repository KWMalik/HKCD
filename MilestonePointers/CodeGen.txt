  NodeEmitter.js                          -> The emitter mixin which adds an emit() function to each node

CodeEmitter.js                            -> Target-machine (JVM) specific code emitter

CodeGenerator.js                          -> Module to start node-visiting and write the generated code to a file

CodeRunner.js                             -> Runs the Jasmin assembler on the code to generate Java class files and then uses Java to run the code

Compiler.js                               -> Ties together all the compiler modules to execute them in a pipeline
