Milestone 2 - Lexer
============================

----------------------------
1. Lexer arguments
----------------------------

Usage: main.j [OPTIONS] INPUT_FILE
Performs lexical analysis on an input file using a grammar.
 -d: Debug flag. Use this option to print debug messages.
 -g GRAMMAR: Specifies the grammar file (default lib/grammar.json).
 -h --help: displays usage information (final option)

The INPUT_FILE may be a folder. In that case, we attempt to parse all of the inputs in that folder and put the output into a subfolder called Out. This is how we generated our output.

----------------------------
2. Location of Files
----------------------------

The output of files, in general, are located in the "Out" directory of the given test files directory. We have been putting our test files in the Test/Files directory.

For milestone 2, the input of the files are located at

    HKCD/Test/Files/Milestone2
    
and the output for the milestone 2 files are located at

    HKCD/Test/Files/Milestone2/Out
    
These follow the conventions of the given input/output files (input files end in .java and output files end in .out). The output files' names are the same as their mapped input files.

----------------------------
2. Location of Source Code
----------------------------

The source code for our project is located in

    HKCD/lib
    
The files ending in .j are Objective-J files and the grammar.json is a file with a JSON string representation of our grammar object.
